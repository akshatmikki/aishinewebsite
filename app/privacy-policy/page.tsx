      <p className="mb-4">
        Vishko22 is committed to safeguarding your privacy and protecting your
        data. This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how we collect, use,
        disclose, and secure the personal information you provide while
        accessing the websites (aishine.ai) other applications operated by
        Vishko22, and when you use our learning products and services
        ("Service(s)"). It also outlines your rights regarding access,
        correction, withdrawal of consent, and data privacy.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The use of any data collected through our Service(s) is strictly limited
        to the purpose of delivering the educational services and features that
        you or your authorized organization have opted into. Terms not defined
        in this Policy will have the meanings assigned in our Terms &
        Conditions. The usage of the terms “personal information,” “personally
        identifiable information,” or “personal data” includes sensitive
        personal data wherever required by applicable laws.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-6 font-medium">
        Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using our websites or any

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">Notice to End Users</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In some cases, accounts may be created by an administrator on behalf of
        an end user (such as an employee, student, or customer of our
        institutional partner). These administrators—typically employers or
        Authorized Training Partners ("Clients")—act as data controllers for
        their users. In such instances, we process personal information under
        the direction of these Clients, and the Client’s privacy policy may also
        apply.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        If you are an end-user accessing Vishko22 via a Client partner, please
        direct any privacy-related questions or data requests to your
        organization’s administrator. Vishko22 is not responsible for our
        Client’s internal data handling practices.
